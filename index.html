				<h2 id="what-kind-of-publishing-is-this-post-about">What kind of publishing is this post about?</h2>
<p>This post is about Incremental Publishing using the out of the box publishing mechanism, not the new Sitecore Publishing Service. There <a href="https://mikael.com/2019/07/learnings-from-a-year-of-implementing-sitecore-publishing-service/">maybe reasons why you can&rsquo;t use SPS just yet</a> for your project.</p>
<p>Again if you are using a Smart or Full site publish this article won&rsquo;t apply.
But it&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.rauljimenez.co.uk/sitecore-publishing-tips/">recommended to setup a scheduled incremental publish</a>.</p>
<p>This post relates to Sitecore 9.3, not reviewed if applicable for Sitecore 10 yet.</p>
<p>Great, so I know this is about Sitecore OOTB Incremental Publishing, and why it&rsquo;s recommended to use this if SPS isn&rsquo;t a good fit, tell me more about this edge case.</p>
<h2 id="edge-case">Edge Case</h2>
<p>Disclaimer, this is an Incremental Publishing Edge Case issue where an item which should be published never gets published, most of the time you probably wouldn&rsquo;t see this issue occur, and if you did spot something wasn&rsquo;t published as it should, you&rsquo;d just smart publish/republish the unpublished items &amp; possibly their children to fix the issue.</p>
<p>You might possibly be thinking this could be a user error, something might not have been pushed through workflow, or not created until very recently (Always good to explore for technical issues before jumping to conclusions).</p>
<p>However if you have ruled out any user issues, and reviewed the logs and confirmed that the item should have been picked up in an Incremental Publish, you need to start looking for the Ghost in the Machine.</p>
<h2 id="ghost-in-the-machine">Ghost in the Machine</h2>
<p><img src="/post/incremental-publishing-edge-case/images/ghost.gif" alt="Ghost"></p>
<p>Working closely with Sitecore Support and with enough diagnostics data from the rare occurrences when this issue would rear it&rsquo;s head, it was spotted that these items which wouldn&rsquo;t get picked up by any incremental publish were saved around the time of the scheduled publishes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore what&rsquo;s going on, and why an item saved very near an incremental publish operation on a rare occurrence might not get picked up.</p>
<h2 id="sql-column-specifications--rounding">Sql Column Specifications &amp; Rounding</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; table stores the Last Publish date as a &ldquo;String&rdquo; including the ticks.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;PublishQueue&rdquo; table &ldquo;Date&rdquo; column stores the date in a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/datetime-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15#rounding-of-datetime-fractional-second-precision">Sql &ldquo;Datetime&rdquo; column which isn&rsquo;t as precise</a> and results in rounding.</p>
<p>As does the &ldquo;Item&rdquo; table &ldquo;Created&rdquo; and &ldquo;Updated&rdquo; columns which both use the same Sql &ldquo;datetime&rdquo; column, with the same rounding issue.</p>

    alt="Datetime Rounding">
</picture>
<p>Due to these differences, say a publishing job was started with value From 14:00:00.017545Z, it would be rounded to 14:00:00.003ms, and would miss an item added at 14:00:00.000ms.</p>
<p>These millisecond round issues could cause an issue with an item not getting published, however that&rsquo;s very small window for the issue to occur.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-save-an-item">What happens when you save an item?</h2>
<p>When you save an item, the items statistics get updated with the timestamp from C#/.NET in memory before getting persisted to the Database.</p>
<p>So the latency to get the record with the timestamp into the database could certainly be an issue/factor.</p>
<p>The datetime value used defaults to not storing the ticks/milliseconds on the item, and just defaults to <code>datetime.ToString(&quot;yyyyMMddTHHmmss&quot;)</code></p>
<p>Truncating any milliseconds or ticks.
(See <code>ItemStatistics.UpdateRevision</code>, <code>DateUtil.IsoNow</code>, <code>DateUtil.ToIsoDate</code>)</p>
<p>So that could certainly be an issue, if saving an item towards the end of the Second (with a high millisecond value).</p>
<p>On save items are added to the <code>publishqueue</code>, with the date field values Updated, PublishDate, UnpublishDate, ValidFrom, ValidTo.
(See <code>DefaultPublishManager.DataEngine_SavedItem</code>, <code>DefaultPublishManager.AddToPublishQueue</code>, <code>DefaultPublishManager.GetActionDateFields</code>)</p>
<p>So that truncated second value gets copied across to the <code>publishqueue</code> table.</p>
<h2 id="example-of-an-edge-case">Example of an Edge Case</h2>
<p>If I save an item at <code>2020-08-13T18:00:00.9881779+00:00</code></p>
<p>It will get saved as being created/modified at <code>2020-08-13T18:00:00.000</code>,
and added to the publish queue</p>
<p>And I have an incremental publish kick off at 18:00, and picks up from the last publish 17:00:00.103-18:00:00.103 as a slight delay in starting.
This doesn&rsquo;t pick up the item which hasn&rsquo;t been created yet at 18:00:00.9881779.</p>
<p>And the future publish operation won&rsquo;t pick it up either as will look for items between 18:00:00.103-19:00:00.103, when it&rsquo;s value will be saved as 18:00:00.000ms.</p>
<h2 id="work-around">Work around</h2>
<p>A work around would be to fix the query to include records affected by this precision/latency issue, at the expense of reprocessing some items more than once.</p>
<p>To do this can customise <code>GetPublishQueueEntries</code> method on the <code>SqlDataProvider</code></p>

Item gets added to the publish queue with value 17:59:59.000ms</p>
<p>Publish Window by default queries for
<code>18:00:00.103-19:00:00.103</code></p>
<p>with the 1 second fix would query for
<code>17:59:59.103-19:00:00.103</code></p>
<p>Both of these would still miss the item at 17:59:59.000ms.</p>
<h2 id="improved-work-around">Improved Work Around</h2>
<p>To round the start time query down to 0 milliseconds, and 0 ticks, can add the following line <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1004698/how-to-truncate-milliseconds-off-of-a-net-datetime">Credit Stack Overflow</a>:</p>

<code>17:59:59.000-19:00:00.103</code>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>TL;DR; OOTB if you save an item at the same time an incremental publish kicks off, depending on the exact timing there is an edge case that it may never get published.</p>
<p>With a small work around in code you can ensure items saved around the time of a scheduled publish get picked up by the next incremental publish. At the expense of reprocessing some items/events.
However this workaround isn&rsquo;t in the form of an official hotfix, and would require extensive testing. No guarantees. Only consider this if are experiencing the issues described, and of course speak with Sitecore Support first.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-this">Do I need this?</h2>
<p>Well firstly you have to be using incremental publishing and scheduled publishing.
And secondly unless you&rsquo;ve spotted items not getting published, have enough editor activity that keep on encountering this issue on rare occasions, you probably don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>However if you are using incremental and scheduled publishing, and have spotted odd issues with items not getting published, and can&rsquo;t explain them due to user error. This might help explain the Ghost in the machine and a work around. But don&rsquo;t apply this fix if you don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>And if you do implement this fix you&rsquo;ll have to test this customisation, as not an official hotfix, and no guarantees. Just a suggestion that this could help if suffering from this particular issue.
And if was implemented incorrectly could lead big problems, e.g. re-processing of events.
So you&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>
<h2 id="longer-term">Longer term</h2>
<p>Longer term I&rsquo;m sure SPS will further improve, and will be able to be used by more customers. At which point Smart Publishing becomes fast enough, we don&rsquo;t need the old incremental publishing.</p>
<p>If there was to be a fix for incremental publishing, the window could be reduced by calculating and storing a last modified time at Sql Server level with millisecond/timestamp precision, rather than using C# and truncating down to the second level with the latency to insert it into the database.
As well as using the DateTime2 column format rather than DateTime with it&rsquo;s millisecond rounding precision issues.
However, this is quite a schema change for an edge case, so the work around will suffice for those that are affected.</p>
<h2 id="sitecore-bug-tracking-reference">Sitecore Bug Tracking Reference</h2>
<p>Sitecore Bug Tracking Reference #397573.</p>
<h2 id="final-disclaimer">Final Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use this work around unless you are experiencing the issues described, and even then perform your own testing, no guarantees.</p>
<p>These code samples haven&rsquo;t been tested, and just give the gist of the fix required.</p>
<p>Work with Sitecore Support to confirm you are experiencing the issue described, as this customisation has a cost to it, and could have negative implications to your solution even if implemented correctly, and even more negative implication if incorrectly implemented.</p>

<p>There are already some posts on this topic of using Precompiled Razor Views, so I won&rsquo;t duplicate that content.</p>
<p>Kam&rsquo;s blog - <a href="https://kamsar.net/index.php/2016/09/Precompiled-Views-with-Sitecore-8-2/">Precompiled Views supported by Sitecore since Sitecore 8.2</a></p>

<p>Chris&rsquo;s blog - <a href="https://chrisperks.co/2018/03/22/hundreds-of-renderings-your-first-page-load-could-be-sloooow/">Slow compilation when using MVC areas/Helix folder structure</a></p>
<p>Matt&rsquo;s blog - <a href="https://www.mattfletcher.co.uk/2019/01/20/beware-of-view-compilation-with-helix-features/">ensuring your razor view paths are unique</a></p>
<p>And probably others, but these one&rsquo;s stood out to me, and relevant for this post.</p>
<p>Read these articles first, I&rsquo;ll wait.</p>
<h2 id="quick-summary">Quick summary</h2>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve read the above articles,
here&rsquo;s a quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we know Precompiled Razor Views are supported by Sitecore since Sitecore 8.2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want to measure/benchmark before and after applying this performance fix, how else would you know it&rsquo;s had the desired effect. And watch out for this Disk IO calls, which seem to be occurring even if have the Sitecore setting disabled &ldquo;UsePhysicalViewsIfNewer&rdquo; which seems counterintuitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are following a MVC areas/Helix style structure with multiple folders for your views, it looks like using precompiled razor view is going to be really beneficial in your case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure you are using unique MVC area/Helix folder names &amp; unique razor file paths across projects to avoid issues, just like you would if they were physical files in one project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ok---ive-read-the-above-articles-what-more-are-you-writing-about">Ok - I&rsquo;ve read the above articles, what more are you writing about?</h2>
<p>Well first I want to draw attention to &ldquo;UsePhysicalViewsIfNewer&rdquo; setting.</p>
<p>Check in your Sitecore setup what this value is set to.</p>
<p>If for example you have received a Sitecore Support patch/hotfix with a new .cshtml file</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E.g. Issue 214239 for &ldquo;\sitecore\shell\client\Business Components Library\version 2\Layouts\Renderings\ListsAndGrids\Grid.cshtml&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which includes a config patch which changes &ldquo;UsePhysicalViewsIfNewer&rdquo; to true to load the .cshtml file with the fix, rather than the precompiled view in the assembly.</p>
<p>Those disk IO calls which seem to occur either way (more on that later), are defiantly going to occur if you tell it to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This also explains the guidance you might see where the .cshtml file last modified data must be more recent than the .dll file, otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t be loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So possibly a Sitecore Support patch to a .cshtml file might undo some of the performance gains we are trying to achieve. As with everything measure.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;UsePhysicalViewsIfNewer&rdquo; set to true, can skip this next section, and skip to the hotfix, otherwise read on.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-a-support-fix-and-performance-settings">I want a support fix and performance settings</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer, I&rsquo;ve only tried this on a dev machine. And not completed benchmarking/testing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe if you are only worried about the Sitecore MVC .cshtml hotfix for Content Authoring, and only want the compilation benefit on Content Delivery so could change this setting &ldquo;UsePhysicalViewsIfNewer&rdquo; to true just for Authoring?</p>
<p>However, if you want to have the compilation benefit on Content Authoring as well as the MVC .cshtml fix. One possible way could be to create a new project named &ldquo;ZZZZZ&hellip;&rdquo; with Razor compilation enabled and place the fixed .cshtml file in that project with the matching path of the file you want to override from Sitecore.</p>
<p>And add to the pre-compilation configuration a reference to this new assembly.</p>

<p>We are going to turn the bug from Matt&rsquo;s blog - <a href="https://www.mattfletcher.co.uk/2019/01/20/beware-of-view-compilation-with-helix-features/">ensuring your razor view paths are unique</a>
into a solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The problem becomes apparent when two assemblies have the same generated virtual view path, <strong>the assembly that comes alphabetically last wins out</strong> and overwrites the value corresponding to the virtual path key string in the _views dictionary.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are going to deliberately overwrite the Sitecore Pre-compiled view, with the fixed Pre-compiled view, but naming the assembly with the fixed .cshtml file with a name Alphabetically after the original Sitecore Assembly.</p>
<p>If this is a good solution without drawback, perhaps support could do this, to save us the time of doing it ourselves?</p>
<p>Or actually Sitecore could re-issue the original .dll with the fixed Razor view, so don&rsquo;t need to overwrite it.</p>
<p>And now with the new Hotfix only model, they probably would do this.</p>
<p>Still this might be relevant for an existing patch you have, prior to the new Hotfix model.</p>
<h3 id="best-of-both">Best of both</h3>
<p>With this technique, can leave &ldquo;UsePhysicalViewsIfNewer&rdquo; set to false, and override a Sitecore precompiled view.</p>

<p>Going back to Jeremy&rsquo;s blog <a href="https://jermdavis.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/an-interesting-side-effect-of-compiled-views/">possible side affect of Precompiled Views</a>. If look at the comments section, can see I enquired about if this was still an issue in Sitecore 9, and had a little more success from Sitecore Support who confirmed this was a bug in Sitecore and not the RazorGenerator project.</p>
<p>Looking at the contents of Sitecore.Support.192470.dll, can see it removes the first MVC view engine from the list, I asked Sitecore Support why and got this answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The setting UsePhysicalViewsIfNewer works as expected for all precompiled views except the ones that come from a couple of SPEAK dlls (Sitecore.Speak.Web.dll and Sitecore.Speak.Components.Web.dll).
The UsePhysicalViewsIfNewer setting value is used to initialize PrecompiledViewAssembly objects which will be a part of the RazorGenerator.Mvc.CompositePrecompiledMvcEngine. Sitecore initializes an instance of Sitecore.Mvc.SitecoreRazorViewEngine derived from the CompositePrecompiledMvcEngine. And further the instantiated engine is encapsulated in the Sitecore.Mvc.InstrumentendViewEngine type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is that there is an extra PrecompiledMvcEngine instance that comes from SPEAK. This particular engine instance ignores the UsePhysicalViewsIfNewer setting. The engine instance gets placed at the very first position of the ViewEngines.Engines list. And the issue happens when this &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; engine is taken via a FirstOrDefault LINQ func by Sitecore MVC.
Please also notice that with the current architecture the only possible way to fix this is to remove the engine from the list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would seem to explain the issue Jeremy was having.</p>
<p>However I&rsquo;ve yet to benchmark this solution, to see if solves the disk IO issue, but got a logical explanation from Sitecore Support.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this is still an issue or fixed in later version of Sitecore after Sitecore 9. But a quick scan through the recent version release notes I can&rsquo;t see either of the public reference numbers 192470 or 119596.</p>

<p>If you are experiencing issues with Compiled Razor views and disk activity even with &ldquo;UsePhysicalViewsIfNewer&rdquo; set to false, perhaps check if this fix is applicable for the version of Sitecore you are on, and measure if it has the desired impact.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Sitecore since Sitecore 6 in 2011.</p>
<p>Keep sharing and trying if didn&rsquo;t make it this year, this is my first year I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be selected for the MVP award after several years of applying. <br />
Although it&rsquo;s not enough to just keep on applying, you can&rsquo;t get the award if you don&rsquo;t apply, and you might get some feedback what you need to improve upon.</p>
<p>A lot of my activity with Sitecore might not be publicly visible, and probably explains why I&rsquo;ve not received this award previously.<br />
Digging out dotpeek, finding the root cause of an issue, and possibly supplying a fix on occasion to Sitecore support for review (of course would always prefer to use an official hotfix, but to prove have found the problem &amp; working solution I might get there first). <br />
Or again using dotpeek finding a way to add in support for a feature that isn&rsquo;t currently supported, and sharing the approach with Sitecore to make it easier to extend in future upgrades, or be integrated into the product in the future.<br />
This might not be visible to the community straight away, but hopefully makes the product better in the long run.</p>
<p>Now with the new single Hotfix model per version of Sitecore, these identified issues fixes are more likely to get into the product quicker, as well as making upgrades easier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to share what I&rsquo;m up to, either blogging, asking/answering questions on Stack Exchange, or presenting when I can.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been on a train the trainer course on .net core, Docker, K8s and AKS, and delivered this training.</p>
<p>As well as attended a course on improving my public speaking skills.</p>
<p>All of which has helped me practice my public speaking.</p>
<p>Special mentions to <a href="https://scug.co.uk/">Sitecore User Group UK</a> and <a href="http://sitecore.events/">Sitecore Discussion Club</a> for letting me present.<br />
And <a href="https://twitter.com/steviemcgill">Steve McGill</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SitecoreMartin">Martin Miles</a> for running them.</p>
<p>As well as to the Sitecore Support &amp; Product teams for collaborating on tickets, and working on getting the fixes/enhancements into the product.</p>
<p>Plus of course the awesome Sitecore community, whether that&rsquo;s Twitter, Sitecore Slack, Blogs, <a href="https://sitecore.stackexchange.com/">Sitecore StackExchange</a>, <a href="https://scug.co.uk/">SCUG Meetups</a> &amp; <a href="http://sitecore.events/">Sitecore Discussion Club</a>, SUGCON, Symposium etc.</p>
<p>As well as the awesome team I work with, but as this is my personal blog I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my blog, more to follow!</p>
