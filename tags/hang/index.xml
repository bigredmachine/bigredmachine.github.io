      <description>Sitecore Log4Net Lockup - Hotfix &amp;amp; Don&amp;rsquo;t Share Appenders This post is about a very rare elusive bug that caused the affected Sitecore instance to freeze up, as well not log anything which gave a clue what the problem was.
It was a combination of a bug in the Sitecore Log4Net code and additional Log4Net configuration that had been added (not OOTB) that caused Sitecore to lock up.
 If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this issue, where a Sitecore instance locks up and you needed to restart IIS/Server, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t need this hotfix, but hopefully will get this hotfix rolled into a future version of Sitecore, so you&amp;rsquo;ll get the benefit then of hopefully never seeing this bug.</description>
