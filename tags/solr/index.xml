      <description>Recently I was looking at building a sitecore search domain index (See Domain vs God index), which had quite a few calculated fields. Lots of the calculated fields were based off similar information about the parent nodes of the current item. And for each calculated field I was performing the same look ups again and again per field on the item.
I thought there has got to be a way to improve this, and found a forum post back from 2015 of someone asking the same question, and with a response of someone else who had solved it for one of the projects they were working on.</description>
