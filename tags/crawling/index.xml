      <description>Following an upgrade to Sitecore 9.0 update 2, from Sitecore 8.2 update 6, spotted that index rebuilds of the default indexes Core, Web &amp;amp; Master were taking much longer than they were before.
Talking to rebuild these 3 index in parallel under 50 mins in Sitecore 8.2, now taking over 6 hours in Sitecore 9 (sometime 20 hours+), for ~1/4 million items in each of the web and master databases.</description>

      <title>Speeding up sitecore crawling</title>

      <description>Recently I was looking at building a sitecore search domain index (See Domain vs God index), which had quite a few calculated fields. Lots of the calculated fields were based off similar information about the parent nodes of the current item. And for each calculated field I was performing the same look ups again and again per field on the item.
I thought there has got to be a way to improve this, and found a forum post back from 2015 of someone asking the same question, and with a response of someone else who had solved it for one of the projects they were working on.</description>
