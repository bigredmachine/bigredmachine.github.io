<p>A lot of people talk about zero downtime, but normally just in the context of Content Delivery.
Either with Azure PAAS websites and swapping slots, or using Azure Traffic Manager to switch over to a different load balancer/set of VMs.</p>
<p>However one of my colleagues found this article, to achieve Zero* downtime for Content Authoring.<br>

<p>*Or as near to Zero as possible as the users Session state will expire, as <a href="https://bigredmachine.github.io/post/why-inproc-session-state-required-on-authoring/">Sitecore requires InProc session state provider on Content Authoring</a>.</p>

<p>I brought up in the sitecore discussion club slack channel that this is an area would like to discuss further, as trying to schedule deployments out of hours isn&rsquo;t great for those who are doing the deployment, and disruptive to the editors who are trying to enter content.<br>
And was put in touch on Slack with the author.</p>
<p>Also at the last Sitecore Discussion club (<a href="http://sitecore.events/),">http://sitecore.events/),</a> the author of this article was there, and presented this idea to the group.</p>
<p>It was interesting to hear that this was created to avoid getting up early to deploy before the authors were in, and that has been used in production, so the idea works.</p>
<p>Although the architecture in the original post was for two websites running on a single machine, and using Lucene indexes, and MSMQ.<br>
There is no reason this can&rsquo;t be updated to use Azure Message Queue, two independent complete stacks (Content Delivery, Content Authoring, SolrCloud).</p>
<p>At the group we also discussed some of the limitations/ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>rollbacks, as it stands would want to be confident before switching over, as no way without data loss to roll back. Unless add a similar queue going in reverse. Although hopefully with enough testing rollbacks shouldn&rsquo;t be a frequent occurrence, so might be acceptable.</li>
<li>transformation layer, say a field had been renamed, a layer between deserializing the message, and applying it to sitecore, would allow the message to be intercepted and updated to the new deployments expected format.</li>
<li>recording content editoring activity like this, could provide a way to record/replay content authoring activities to simulate authoring load in a test environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s an idea worth exploring further, more updates as we try this out ourselves.</p>

				<h2 id="sitecore-fast-queries-">Sitecore (Fast) Queries</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a few blog posts on avoiding using (fast) Sitecore queries on Content Delivery.</p>

</ul>
<p>Summary Fast always goes to the database, and even a normal Sitecore query can go from being a slow page, to bringing your site to it&rsquo;s knees if that page is hit frequently enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had experience of this on inheriting a solution which would do three sitecore queries on a page load for calendar events, for items within a folder. Normally the page would load within a few seconds, not great but usable. However when a search engine got onto the page, and decided to crawl through the calendar navigation links, which are effectively infinite, the execution time grew and grew.</p>
<p>Until the page wouldn&rsquo;t load in a couple of mins, .net thread pool limits were reached, and the site was effectively down.</p>
<p>The quick fix was to prevent these pages from being indexed, as well as indicate not to follow the calendar links forever.</p>
<p>The longer term fix was to switch to Content Search, using an index to load the content, to speed the page up (as well as keeping the indicators not to follow the infinite links).</p>
<p>(Of course using Sitecore Query for a few sub items, or getting an item by id is acceptable, but never Fast)</p>
<h2 id="link-database-">Link Database</h2>
<p>So onto the topic of this post, the Link Database certainly has it&rsquo;s place, finding references/referrers of items for one on Content Authoring being it&rsquo;s primary usage.</p>
<p>There are some considerations before you start adding a dependency to the Links database in your code. (Hint, use Content Search were possible).</p>
<p>The Links Database, is more of a table which used to reside in the Core database by default until Sitecore 9, and then was moved to the Web database ahead of removing the dependency on the Core database.</p>
<p>We switched back to using the Core database to store the links again for reason I&rsquo;ll come to shortly.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-limitation-">Scaling Limitation?</h3>
<p>If you work in a Scaled environment though, you may have more than one Web or Core database.
There can be only one link database(Table) maintained though.
So in a multi-region scaled environment, you&rsquo;ll be travelling across regions to the database with the maintained link database.</p>
<p>Now it might be with database replication that this problem gets resolved, and other regions can query a read only copy of a replicated database which contains the Link Database(table).</p>
<p>However we are avoiding using the Link Database on content delivery so we don&rsquo;t encounter any scalability issues.</p>
<h3 id="rebuild-speed-">Rebuild Speed</h3>
<p>Rebuilding the Link Database occurs in serial (one Databases links after the next get rebuilt in serial) and takes a long time. E.g, 8+ Hours.
I understand from Sitecore support there are some experimental patches to speed up making the index rebuild faster/rebuild it in parallel, so far haven&rsquo;t got around to trying these, but possibly an avenue worth pursuing.</p>
<h3 id="deadlocks-">Deadlocks</h3>
<p>I understand the situation used to be worse before Sitecore 7.1, were selects didn&rsquo;t use the nolock hint,
but still regularly see deadlocks on this table in production even on Sitecore 9.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SQL Server transaction deadlocks related to the link database could occur when multiple threads were creating and moving items concurrently, for example, when the threads created items that were stored in item buckets. This has been fixed by changing the GetReferrers(Item, ID) method in the SqlLinkDatabase class so that it uses WITH NOLOCK when reading from the Links table. (401393)

<p> </p>
<h3 id="bad-execution-plan-">Bad Execution Plan</h3>
<p>Sometimes when Sql Server evaluates a query on the Link Database(table), depending on the values being queried, it was deciding to do a TableScan to find an entry.
This would get saved as the execution plan, and all the queries would go slower/use up more DTU&rsquo;s, until the execution plan was discarded.</p>
<h3 id="high-dtu-usage-">High DTU usage</h3>
<p>We noticed that every publish, there was a DTU spike.
We even saw some issues on the live site because of these Bad Execution Plan, combined with these High DTU spikes, on other pages trying to query the same database under load.
So something had to be done, other than the immediate increase the DTU limits on the database server, and throw money at the problem.</p>
<h3 id="disable-updating-the-link-database-on-publish-">Disable updating the link database on publish</h3>
<p>The following setting cut down the DTU spikes we were seeing on every publish, as we don&rsquo;t use the Links Database on Content Delivery, was a quick win for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disables incremental updates to the link database during publishing operations as an experimental optimization to speed up publishing (25% on average).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://community.sitecore.net/technical_blogs/b/latest_technical_reinnovations/posts/enabling-parallel-publishing-with-sitecore-7-2">Enabling Parallel Publishing and related optimizations</a></p>
<pre><code>&lt;setting name=&quot;LinkDatabase.UpdateDuringPublish&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="fixing-the-bad-execution-plan-">Fixing the Bad Execution Plan</h3>
<p>It was choosing to do a Table Scan, because unfortunately there was no covering index for the query, because one of the columns is of type &ldquo;ntext&rdquo; which prevents it from being part of the index.</p>
<p>Sitecore confirmed that according to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/ntext-text-and-image-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017">MS documentation</a> that ntext will be removed from future versions of Sql Server. So in the future this column type will change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT! ntext, text, and image data types will be removed in a future version of SQL Server. Avoid using these data types in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use them. Use nvarchar(max), varchar(max), and varbinary(max) instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we are currently trying out applying the following change to the Links Database(Table)</p>
<pre><code>ALTER TABLE [Links] ALTER COLUMN TargetPath NVARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL
GO

CREATE INDEX ndxLinks_SourceItemId_SourceDatabase_ALL ON [Links]
([SourceItemID], [SourceDatabase])
INCLUDE ([SourceLanguage], [SourceVersion], [SourceFieldID], [TargetDatabase], [TargetItemID], [TargetLanguage], [TargetVersion], [TargetPath] )
WITH (ONLINE=ON, SORT_IN_TEMPDB=ON)
</code></pre>
<p>And so far doesn&rsquo;t appear to be causing much overhead to writes, is having the desired affect on preventing a bad execution plan and queries are using the new index, and to review if this has any beneficial impact to the deadlocks.</p>
<p>To update further once released to production/have more feedback.
Hopefully these changes will come through in a future update of the sitecore product.</p>
<h2 id="summary-">Summary</h2>
<p>Be careful before taking a dependency on the Links Database, your architecture in the future if you are planning on moving to a scaled active/active multi region setup might not support it.</p>
<p>If you are using the Links Database on Content Delivery then you won&rsquo;t have this luxury of being able to turn off this setting to not update the Web links database on publish. If you aren&rsquo;t using the Links Database, then maybe turn off this feature to save some DTU&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>If you are also seeing slow queries of the links database/high DTU&rsquo;s, maybe try out this Sql Schema/Index and test yourself, or wait for this to become part of the sitecore product.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend using Sitecore Content Search where possible.</p>

<p>Talking to rebuild these 3 index in parallel under 50 mins in Sitecore 8.2, now taking over 6 hours in Sitecore 9 (sometime 20 hours+), for ~1/4 million items in each of the web and master databases.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Looking at the logs could see they were flooded with messages.</p>
<p><code>XXXX XX:XX:XX WARN More than one template field matches. Index Name : sitecore_master_index Field Name : XXXXXXXXX</code></p>
<p>Initial discussions with Sitecore Support were to apply some patches to filter out the messages being written to the log files. <a href="https://github.com/SitecoreSupport/Sitecore.Support.195567">bug #195567</a><br/>
However this felt more like treating the symptoms rather than the cause.</p>
<p>With performance still only being slightly improved, using reflection and overrides, tried to patch the behaviour  in <em>SolrFieldNameTranslator</em> to not need to write theses warnings to the log files in the first place. Unfortunately the code had lots of private non virtual methods, and implemented an internal interface, which proved quite tricky to override, without requiring IL modification, so really was something for Sitecore to fix.<br/>
But even after all this, still around 4+ hours to rebuild the index on a good day.</p>
<p>I observed an individual rebuild of the Core index was quite fast on it&rsquo;s own, ~5 mins.
But Sitecore Support confirmed that the algorithm used, would use resource stealing, to make the jobs finish about the same time each other (Slow job would steal resource from faster job).<br />
And confirmed in Sitecore 8.2 update 6 all indexes were taking a similar time when run in parallel.<br />
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskscheduler?view=netframework-4.7.2#work-stealing">Work Stealing in Task Scheduler</a><br />
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jennifer/2009/06/26/work-stealing-in-net-4-0/">Blog on Work Stealing</a></p>
<p>Resources on the servers, and DTU usage on the database were minimal. So didn&rsquo;t appear to be maxing out.</p>
<p>So what was the issue, some locking, or job scheduling changed in Sitecore 9?</p>
<p>Well to find the answer some performance traces were required, from a test environment where could replicate this issue.<br />
After enough performance traces were performed, Sitecore support observed that there were lots of idle threads doing nothing.<br />
Which was odd on a server with 16 cores, and 15 threads allocated for indexing.<br/>
Sitecore support were then able to find the bug, The bug is specific to the strategy <em>OnPublishEndAsynchronousSingleInstanceStrategy</em> which was being used by the web index.<br/>
This strategy overrides <em>Run()</em> method and initialises <em>LimitedConcurrencyLevelTaskSchedulerForIndexing</em> singleton with the incorrect <em>MaxThreadLimit</em> value.</p>

<p>This code appears to be the same in previous versions, likely we were using <em>onPublishEndAsync</em> rather than <em>onPublishEndAsyncSingleInstance</em> before the upgrade.</p>
<p>Ask for bug fix #285903 from Sitecore support if you are affected by this, so your config settings don&rsquo;t get overwritten.</p>
